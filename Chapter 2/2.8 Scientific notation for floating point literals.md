#  2.8 Scientific Notation for Floating-point Literals

Scientific notation serves as a valuable representation for floating-point numbers that are significantly larger or smaller than zero, such as 6.02 x 10^23. A floating-point literal expressed in scientific notation employs the letter 'e' followed by the exponent of 10, as in 6.02e23 to denote 6.02 x 10^23. Here, 'e' stands for exponent. Similarly, 0.001 can be represented as 1 x 10^-3, written as 1.0e-3 using scientific notation.

When utilizing scientific notation for a floating-point literal, it is advisable to ensure that the leading digit is non-zero.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
   double avogadrosNumber = 6.02e23; // Approximation of atoms per mole  
   double gramsPerMoleGold = 196.9665;
   double gramsGold;
   double atomsGold;
   
   cout << "Enter grams of gold: ";
   cin  >> gramsGold;
   
   atomsGold = gramsGold / gramsPerMoleGold * avogadrosNumber;
   
   cout << gramsGold << " grams of gold contains ";
   cout << atomsGold << " atoms" << endl;
   
   return 0;
}
```
