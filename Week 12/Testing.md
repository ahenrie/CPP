# Testing

## Learning Objectives

1. State the role of testing in development
2. Explain why testing cannot generally verify the correctness of a program
3. Explain what is meant by "coverage" in the context of testing
4. List at least 3 types of testing
5. Demonstrate test case selection. 

## What is testing good for?

1. Verify: Confirm the truth of
2. Validate: Give evidence for

## What can testing do

1. Prove that software is broken
2. The goal of testing is discover where it is broken.


## Test Converage

Def: The percent of things we want to execute that we do,,
  - Code Coverage: Percentage of code that is executed at least once by a test suite.
  - Path Coverage: Percentage of possible paths that are executed.
  - Branch Coverage: Percentage of branches that are tested at least one in each direction. 

## Types of Test

1. Unit Test: Focused on a specific and isolated piece of the system. Usually automated. 
2. Integration Testing: Two or more subsystems are tested as an integrated whole. Usually automated. 
3. System Testing: Put the whole thing together and see if it works. Automation becomes more difficult.
