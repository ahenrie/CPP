# Operators: new, delete, and ->

## The new Operator

The new operator allocated memory for the given type and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. If the type is a class, the new operator calls the class's constructor after allocating memory for the class's member variable.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Point {
public:
   Point();

   double X;
   double Y;
};

Point::Point() {
   cout << "In Point default constructor" << endl;

   X = 0;
   Y = 0;
}

int main() {
   Point* sample = new Point;
   cout << "Exiting main()" << endl;
   return 0;
}
```
1. The Point class contains two members, X and Y, both doubles.
2. The new operator does 2 things. First, enough space is allocated for the Point object's 2 members, starting at memory address 46.
3. Then the Point constructor is called, displaying a message and setting the X and Y values.
4. The new operator returns a pointer to the allocated and initialized memory at address 46.
