# Pointer Basics

A pointer is declared by including * before the pointer's name. EX: `int* maxItemPointer;` Normally, a pointer is initialized with another variable's address. 
The reference operator `&` obtains a variable's address. EX: `&someVariable` returns the memory address of a variable someVariable. When a pointer is initialized with anotehr variable's address, the ponter points to the variable. 

```cpp
int main() {
   int someInt;
   int* valPointer;

   someInt = 5;
   cout << "someInt address is " << &someInt << endl;

   valPointer = &someInt;        
   cout << "valPointer is " << valPointer << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

## Dereferencing Pointers

The dereference operator `*` is prepended to a ponter variable's name to retrieve the data to where the pointer points. EX: if valPointer points to a memory 
address containing the interger 123, then `cout << *valPointer << endl;` outputs 123.

```cpp
int main() {
   int someInt;
   int* valPointer;  

   someInt = 5;
   cout << "someInt address is " << &someInt << endl;

   valPointer = &someInt;        
   cout << "valPointer is " << valPointer << endl;

   cout << "*valPointer is " << *valPointer << endl;

   *valPointer = 10;   // Changes someInt to 10

   cout << "someInt is " << someInt << endl;
   cout << "*valPointer is " << *valPointer << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

## Null Pointer

When a pointer is declared, the pointer variable holds an unknown address until the pointer is initialized. However, someitmes we wish the pointer to point to nothing.
This can be done using the `nullptr`. EX: `*varPointer = nullptr;`
