# Pointer and Arrays

## Pointer Arithmetic

Since a pointer is number, we can perform arithmetic. Pointer can be added to and subtracted from. The result of p+n, p is a pointer an n is n-elements pas the address p. 
For example, if the type of p is double*, then p+n is computed as p+sizeof(double)*n bytes. So the expression points at the nth array element past where p points. This is only done with an array.

**A pointer that points at an array, will default to the first node of the array if not specified --> The name of an array becomes a pointer to its first element.**

It is vital that n in p+n never goes beyond the memory allocated for the array. For this reason, pointer arithmetic is rarely used, and is usually used within bounds of an array. The compiler does not check that the expression will be within bounds of the array.
Memory bugs that this can cause are hard to debug and cause havoc at runtime. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double a[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
    cout << "sizeof(a) = " << sizeof(a) << endl;
    double* p = a;             // Copies address of a[0] into p 
    cout << "sizeof(p) = " << sizeof(p) << endl;

    cout << *p << endl;
    cout << p[0] << endl;      // Same as *p
    cout << *(p+4) << endl;
    cout << p[4] << endl;

    // Print backwards
    p = a+4;                   // Point at the 5
    while (p >= a)
        cout << *p-- << ' ';
    cout << endl;
}

/* Output:
sizeof(a) = 40
sizeof(p) = 8
1
1
5
5
5 4 3 2 1

```

1. The sizeof operator gives the number of bytes its object occupies in memory. Doubles are 8 byts, so an array of 5 doubles occupies 40 bytes
2. There is an equivalence using pointer arithmetic and array indexing to access elements in an array:
    `a[i] = *(a+i)`
   Where a is eithr the name of the array or a pointer to the first element.
3. Whenever an array name is used in an expression other than as an argument to sizeof(), it ocnverts to a pointer to the first element. 
   Both addresses of both sides of the formula above can be taken to get an equivalent formula:
     `&a[i] = a+i`

## Negative Indices

There are times when using negative indices can be convenient. In some numeric applications, for example, "smoothed" imput data is easier to analyze. The following uses a pointer to smooth data points:

The smoothed data above was obtained by replacing the data points from the original array with a weighted average of the 7 points surrounding each data point (including itself):

`smooth[i] = (raw[i-3] + 2*raw[i-2] + 3*raw[i-1] + 3*raw[i] + 3*raw[i+1] + 2*raw[i+2] + raw[i+3]) / 15;`

This can also be done with pointer arithmetic:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int smooth_it(int* p) {
    // We assume there are 3 points before and after location p
    int sum = p[-3] + 2*p[-2] + 3*p[-1] + 3*p[0] + 3*p[1] + 2*p[2] + p[3];
    return int(sum/15);
}

int main() {
    const int n = 3072;
    int raw[n], smooth[n];

    // Read in raw data
    ifstream f("2_Record2308.dat");
    int val;
    for (int i = 0; f >> val; ++i)   // f >> val will be false when the end-of-file is encountered when attempting to read
        raw[i] = val;

    // Copy first 3 and last 3 values to smooth
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        smooth[i] = raw[i];
        smooth[n-1-i] = raw[n-1-i];
    }

    // Smooth the rest of the values
    for (int i = 3; i < n-3; ++i)
        smooth[i] = smooth_it(raw+i);
}
```
