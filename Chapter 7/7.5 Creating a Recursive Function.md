# Creating a Recursive Function

There are two steps to creating a recursive function:
1. Write the base case -- Every recursive function has a case that returns a value without performing a recursive call aka a base case.
2. Write the recursive case -- The case that is called over and over until the base it hit.

## Example 
```cpp
int NFact(int N) {

   int factResult;
   if (N <= 1) { // Base case
      factResult = 1;
   }
   // FIXME: Finish
   return factResult;
}

// main(): Get N, print NFact(N)
```
A common error is to not cover all possible base cases in a recursive function. Another common error is to write a recursive function that doesn't always reach a base case. Both errors may lead to infinite recursion, causing the program to fail.

Typically, programmers will use two functions for recursion. An "outer" function is intended to be called from other parts of the program, like the function int CalcFactorial(int inVal). An "inner" function is intended only to be called from that outer function, for example a function int CalcFactorialHelper(int inVal). The outer function may check for a valid input value, e.g., ensuring inVal is not negative, and then calling the inner function. Commonly, the inner function has parameters that are mainly of use as part of the recursion, and need not be part of the outer function, thus keeping the outer function more intuitive.
