# Intro to Recursion

## What is an algorithm?
**Defenition:** An algorithm is a sequence of steps for solving a given problem.
Some problems can be solved using recursion. A **recursive algorithm** breaks the problem into smaller sub parts and applies the same algorithm to solve the smaller problems. 

### Example of Recursion - Mowing the Lawn
1. Mow the lawn
   - Mow the front yard
     * steps to mow front yard   
   - Mow the backyward
     * steps to mow the back yard
