# Stack Overflow

Recursion enables an elegant solution to some problems. But, for large problems, deep recursion can cause memory problems. Part of a program's memory is reserved to support function calls. Each function call places a new stack frame on the stack, for local parameters, local variables, and more function items. Upon return, the frame is deleted.

Deep recursion could fill the stack region and cause a stack overflow, meaning a stack frame extends beyond the memory region allocated for stack. Stack overflow usually causes the program to crash and report an error like: segmentation fault, access violation, or bad access.

The animation showed a tiny stack region for easy illustration of stack overflow.

The size of parameters and local variables results in a larger stack frame. Large vectors, arrays, or strings declared as local variables, or passed by copy, can lead to faster stack overflow.

A programmer can estimate recursion depth and stack size to determine whether stack overflow might occur. Sometimes a non-recursive algorithm must be developed to avoid stack overflow.
