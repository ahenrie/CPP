# C++ History

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, researchers at AT&T Bell Labs, authored a book introducing a novel high-level programming language known as C. This name was a successor to a language named B, which in turn was influenced by BCPL. C swiftly rose to prominence and dominated the programming landscape during the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1985, Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++, a language derived from C. C++ incorporated new features that facilitated object-oriented programming, alongside various enhancements. The "++" in the name C++ is a reference to the C increment operator, conveying the idea of advancement or improvement beyond C.

Both C and C++ are widely chosen as initial programming languages, finding extensive application in desktop and embedded systems. Additionally, there are variations of C++, such as C# for Microsoft Windows development and Objective-C for Apple ecosystem programming. Many contemporary languages, including Java, exhibit significant influences from C and C++.

A popularity ranking of programming languages in January 2023, determined through programming-related searches on popular search engines, yielded the following results:
